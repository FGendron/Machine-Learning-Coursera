# Machine-Learning-Coursera
Jupyter notebooks to perform Machine Learning.
Exemples are from the Coursera MOOC on Machine Learning from Standford Uni. 
Originally designed in Octave, I have redone the thing in python using jupyter notebooks.

Ordering:
  - Ex1 : Linear Regression with one variable
  - Ex2 : Linear Regression with multiple variables
  - Ex3 : Logistic Regression and Multi-Class Classification
  - Ex4 : Neural Network with the Handwritting digit problem
  - Ex5 : Regularized Linear Regression and Bias Vs. Variance
